**Notes**
- I couldn't filter the `Employee Name` field because it's doesn't exists in the API data.
- Owing to the lack of time, it was not possible to finish all the requirements as well as there are some bugs that needs to be solved!


- I've used SWR for fetching the data.
- React-table for display filtering, pagination and sorting the data.
- chakraUI for building the UI Components.
- Jest as a test runner.
